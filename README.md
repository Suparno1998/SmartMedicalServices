# SmartMedicalServices
The project aims to improve the medical health care services in India. The incorporation of Information Technology can sort out many problems existing in our current health care scenario.<br>
The objectives of the project are<br>
1. Develop a medical emergency response system<br>
  a. Nearest hospitals to consult in case of emergency<br>
  b. Information about the doctor who is in charge of emergency<br>
  c. Smartly fill out the "patient registration form" enroute to the hospital and send it to the hospital via GMAIL API <br>
  d. Inform the doctor of the condition of patient<br>
2. Create and maintain a real-time database, which would contain all the vital informations about the hospital, like <br>
  a. Number of doctors currently on service<br>
  b. Number of empty beds available (in case of emergency)<br>
  c. Is a particular drug currently available at the pharmacy of the hospital<br>
3. Create a secure patient medical record directory, to be consulted for further treatments, accessible only after the authorisation by the owner of the record (the patient). <br>
4. Create an UI for the doctors to generate digital prescription. <br>
5. Create an UI for MOBILE HEALTHCARE SERVICE or HEALTHCARE ON A VAN. Consulting with the doctors via video conference. Useful for providing healthcare services to remote parts of India and villages where quality healthcare service is not available.<br>
