# SmartMedicalServices
The project aims to improve the medical health care services in India. The incorporation of Information Technology can sort out many problems existing in our current health care scenario.
The objectives of the project
1. Develop a medical emergency response system<br>
  a. Nearest hospitals to consult in case of emergency
  b. Information about the doctor who is in charge of emergency
  c. Smartly fill out the "patient registration form" enroute to the hospital and send it to the hospital via GMAIL API
  d. Inform the doctor of the condition of patient
2. Create and maintain a real-time database, which would contain all the vital informations about the hospital, like 
  a. Number of doctors currently on service
  b. Number of empty beds available
  c. Is a particular drug currently available at the pharmacy of the hospital
3. Create a secure patient medical record directory, to be consulted for further treatments, accessible only after the authorisation by the owner of the record (the patient).
4. Create an UI for the doctors to generate digital prescription.
5. Create an UI for MOBILE HEALTHCARE SERVICE or HEALTHCARE ON A VAN. Consulting with the doctors via video conference. Useful for providing healthcare services to remote parts of India and villages where quality healthcare service is not available.
